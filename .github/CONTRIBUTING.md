# Contributing to notion-lm-crx (Notion LifeManagement Chrome Extension).

ðŸ™Œ Firstly, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸ™Œ

The following are the set of guidelines for contributing towards this repository on Github. These are mostly guidelines
, not rules. Use your best judgement, and feel free to propose changes to this project in a pull request.

## Code Contribution

## 1. Where to start from?

If you've noticed a bug or have a question, then kindly [search the issue tracker][tracker] to see if someone
else has already created a ticket. If not, go ahead and [add one][new issue]!

## 2. Want to fix an issue or add a new feature?

If this is something you think you can fix, then follow the following steps:

### Step 1: Discuss

Before jumping on any ticket or any feature which you think should be there in the framework, discuss with me on my [site][] or email me @ dsouzasunny1436@gmail.com. Once you get go-ahead, you can proceed by following the steps mentioned hereafter.

### Step 2: Setup your E-mail in Git

Assuming you have already done this. But if you are new and may forget this, you can do it as described [here][setup].

### Step 3: Fork and clone the repository

To Fork and clone the repository, see this useful [post][fork].

### Step 4: Create new Branch

Now create a new branch with a descriptive name in your forked repo. Refer [here][branch] to know about Git branches.

### Step 5: Commit with a descriptive message

If committing a fix for a ticket, always start with `Fixed #[Ticket ID]` than describe the changes in detail.
For an example on how to write a proper commit message, see [this][commitHelp] post.

### Step 6: Push changes to your cloned fork

After committing the changes, you need to push the commit to your cloned repo by executing `git push origin your-branch-name` command in the terminal.

### Step 7: Send Pull Request

Sending Pull Request will be the last step of your contribution. To know how to raise a Pull Request, see [this][pr] post.

> **NOTE:** From your second contribution onwards, you can skip steps **(1) and (2)**.


### Working on open tickets

Any work being done on any open tickets, should be done in a new branch with naming pattern `issue-<ticket no>` created from `develop` branch.

### Pull Request pre-requisites

Any Pull Request raised should make sure following checks are successful:
- Pull Request is raised to merge changes to `develop` branch.
- Commits is GPG signed.
- There is at least one reviewer.
- Github Action tests are green.
- Branch is up to date with `develop` branch.

### Code Styling

There is always a chance of different code styling when many contributors work together on a project.

Make sure to format the code before sending the **Pull Request**.

## Issues and Suggestions.

If you find any issue in the framework or you have any suggestions for enhancement, please feel free to raise a ticket for it. Together we can make the framework even more effective and easy for other Test Engineers to use it in their daily automation tasks.
