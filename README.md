# notion-lm-crx
A chrome extension which works with notion-lm-api to achieve automation in Notion workspace.


**PLEASE NOTE** - this doesnt work standalone and **WILL NEED** the [notion-lm-api](https://github.com/sunnydsouza/notion-lm-api) to be deployed on a suitable environment. 
Also, the automations with this extension, **ONLY** works on [Sunny's Notion LifeManagement(LM) templates](https://www.notion.so/Templates-a73384cbb11a45bdac0af6d04085bb62)

This is a chrome extension which works alongside the Notion LM Api (designed in Python Flask). There is also a version of this which works as a tampermonkey script. 

This is basically the improvized version over version 1. Please view the screenshots and documention below

### *Whats does the extension do?*

Basically, the extension dynamically adds  options (in form of buttons) on feature task pages/ Idea task list/ GTD pages sub tasks pages. The extension is basically to help manage tasks by providing the below options

### Improvements in version > V2.0.0
- All forms are now migrated from JQueryUI to Bootstrap. They are much more compact, refined and has a elegant polished look
- Automation forms now include robust validations (Check screenshots below)
- Beatiful notifications on status of automations (Growl notifications)

## How and where is the extension option shown
The extension dynamically adds a dropdown menu wherever the notion view name matches keywords like "This features task list"/"This idea task list"/ "Todays task"/"GTD Sessions"

![extension menu](docs/images/v2.0.0/screenshot1.png)

**Also** for the extension to work, you would need a checkbox property with name `SNH` as the database property

![extension menu](docs/images/v2.0.0/screenshot14.png)

You should check the required tasks before using the `Notion LM` dropdown options.

## Plan
- Ability to select multiple tasks and plan them on selected day/week/month

- Ability to priortize tasks

## LogHours
Ability to log hours against single or multiple tasks at once. 

If multiple tasks are selected and multiple dates are selected in ‚ÄúWorked on dates‚Äù, then in that case, the hours are **equally** distributed across multiple tasks and dates

eg: if 2 tasks are selected and you have worked on both for 2 days, and the hours logged in ‚ÄúLog Hours‚Äù field is 10, then hours logged across each task would be 10/2*2=2.5/each day

## MarkDone
You can *ONLY* put in one ‚ÄúCompleted Date‚Äù (obvious) but can select multiple ‚ÄúWorked on dates‚Äù, as you could have worked on the tasks for say, a week or so.

The principle of logged hours remains same here - if 2 tasks are selected and you have worked on both for 2 days, and the hours logged in ‚ÄúLog Hours‚Äù field is 10, then hours logged across each task would be 10/2*2=2.5/each day

Logging hours could be optional as you might just want to mark the task complete. You get an option to choose to log hours or cancel the same.

## ClearAll
This simply unchecks all checkboxes in `SNH` column/property


- Below are the features migrated from **verison 1**
    - Ability to perform operations on multiple tasks together
    - Marking task/tasks done(which automatically adds the completed date/week/month/year properties)
    - Log hours against task/tasks or mark them completed together
    - Plan task/tasks to a date/month/week
    - Auto add filters to feature task page, so that when tasks are added to the filtered database, most mandatory fields/properties are already filled in
