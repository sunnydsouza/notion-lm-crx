### *Whats does the extension do?*

Basically, the extension dynamically adds  options (in form of buttons) on feature task pages/ Idea task list/ GTD pages sub tasks pages. The extension is basically to help manage tasks by providing the below options

- Below are the features migrated from **verison 1**
    - Ability to perform operations on multiple tasks together
    - Marking task/tasks done(which automatically adds the completed date/week/month/year properties)
    - Log hours against task/tasks or mark them completed together
    - Plan task/tasks to a date/month/week
    - Auto add filters to feature task page, so that when tasks are added to the filtered database, most mandatory fields/properties are already filled in

## Log Hours

Ability to log hours against single or multiple tasks at once. 

If multiple tasks are selected and multiple dates are selected in ‚ÄúWorked on dates‚Äù, then in that case, the hours are **equally** distributed across multiple tasks and dates

eg: if 2 tasks are selected and you have worked on both for 2 days, and the hours logged in ‚ÄúLog Hours‚Äù field is 10, then hours logged across each task would be 10/2*2=2.5/each day

## Mark task/tasks as ‚ÄòDone‚Äô

You can *ONLY* put in one ‚ÄúCompleted Date‚Äù (obvious) but can select multiple ‚ÄúWorked on dates‚Äù, as you could have worked on the tasks for say, a week or so.

The principle of logged hours remains same here - if 2 tasks are selected and you have worked on both for 2 days, and the hours logged in ‚ÄúLog Hours‚Äù field is 10, then hours logged across each task would be 10/2*2=2.5/each day
